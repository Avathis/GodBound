# GodBound (SP) - Unbound (MP)
Currently a learning ground where I practice and apply everything I deem as cool any given time (E.g Character execution, camera work, distance matching, Combo systems, etc...).

About 2 months ago, I challanged myself to create an multiplayer off-shoot of my original idea - GodBound, where Gods, or their iteration can clash till death.
Got a pretty good hang of it in about a month, and have been making some pretty great proggress in both gameplay and functionality,
but things in which I don't specialize have been slowing me down (VFX, SFX, Animation. etc...)
For the most part I've managed to break down pieces of assets I own and bend them to my will.
